6. Check "Add a README file".
7. Choose "MIT License" from the "Add a license" dropdown.
8. Click "Create repository".

## Uploading the Project Files

Once the repository is created, you can upload the files using Git:

```bash
# Clone the new repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-api-tools.git
cd obsidian-api-tools

# Copy all the project files into this directory
# (This should already be done if you're working in the directory)

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Obsidian API Tools package"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

5. Add a commit message: "Initial commit: Obsidian API Tools package".
6. Click "Commit changes".

## After Uploading

2. Update the repository settings as needed (collaborators, branch protection, etc.).
3. Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing.
4. Add any GitHub-specific labels or issue templates if needed.

## Next Steps

After setting up the repository, you might want to:

1. Set up GitHub Pages to host the documentation.
2. Create a PyPI package for easier installation.
3. Add badges to the README.md (build status, version, etc.).
4. Consider setting up automated testing with GitHub Actions.
5. Document any contribution guidelines.
